# 📘 Storyteller’s Guide: Capturing Preconditions, Risks & Contextual Factors in Toride Evaluation

> This guide helps community-based storytellers, facilitators, and youth leaders safely and effectively gather stories and observations that reveal what makes the **Toride** method work—or not work—in their unique contexts. It supports ethical, inclusive, and grounded storytelling that informs better evaluation practices.

## ✅ SECTION 1: What Must Be in Place – Preconditions

### 🎯 What this means:
Preconditions are the things that **must exist** before Toride can be safely and effectively used. These include community trust, storytelling culture, safe space, inclusion, and readiness to participate.

### 🧾 What to Look For:

| Element                               | What to Ask / Observe                                              | Real-Life Example                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trust**                             | “Do people feel safe sharing personal stories?”                    | In a village storytelling circle, participants opened up only after a respected elder introduced the session.             |
| **Cultural openness to storytelling** | “Is storytelling part of daily life or conflict resolution?”       | In rural North West Cameroon, storytelling is often used around firesides and respected by all ages.                      |
| **Safe & neutral space**              | “Where do people feel safe to speak freely?”                       | During a session with IDP girls, a community center—not school—was chosen because it felt less official and intimidating. |
| **Inclusion mechanisms**              | “Are women, youth, disabled people, and minorities participating?” | In one Toride session, a facilitator noticed girls only spoke up after boys left the room.                                |
| **Time and willingness**              | “Are people ready and available to share?”                         | In farming communities, stories were best collected late afternoon when work was done.                                    |

---

### 📣 Story Prompts:
* "Tell me about a time people in your community came together to talk or solve something through stories. What helped them speak openly?"
* "When you were in the session, who seemed the most comfortable sharing? Who stayed quiet?"

---

## ⚠️ SECTION 2: What Can Go Wrong – Risks

### 🎯 What this means:
These are challenges or harms that may occur during storytelling, especially when people are vulnerable, marginalized, or fearful.

### 🧾 What to Look For:

| Risk Type                         | What to Ask / Observe                                    | Real-Life Example                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emotional distress**            | “Did someone get overwhelmed, cry, or stop talking?”     | A widow broke down while recalling how conflict separated her from her children.          |
| **Re-traumatization**             | “Did a story bring up painful memories without support?” | A youth participant relived a kidnapping incident and later withdrew from the session.    |
| **Power imbalance**               | “Did someone dominate or interrupt others?”              | During a mixed-age session, elders frequently spoke over younger women.                   |
| **Confidentiality risks**         | “Are people afraid their story will be shared wrongly?”  | A girl whispered that her family would disown her if her story about abuse became public. |
| **Cultural or political tension** | “Did storytelling cause conflict between groups?”        | A story about land ownership triggered a heated argument between two community members.   |

---

### 📣 Story Prompts:
* "Was there a moment where someone seemed hurt or uncomfortable telling their story?"
* "Has anyone ever felt unsafe or judged for something they shared in a story circle?"

## 🌍 SECTION 3: What Is Around Us – Contextual Factors

### 🎯 What this means:
Contextual factors are the **surrounding conditions**—social, political, cultural, environmental—that shape how the Toride method is used, received, and understood.

### 🧾 What to Look For:

| Context Type                       | What to Ask / Observe                                           | Real-Life Example                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conflict or insecurity**         | “Are there tensions or violence that affect openness?”          | In a conflict zone in Bamenda, people were afraid to talk openly about armed actors.            |
| **Cultural norms**                 | “Who is expected to speak or stay silent?”                      | In some communities, young women are discouraged from speaking in public.                       |
| **Language and literacy**          | “Can everyone express themselves easily?”                       | A participant switched to Pidgin English after struggling with formal French prompts.           |
| **Technology & access**            | “Is the setting appropriate for audio or video capture?”        | Electricity outages made it difficult to record or play back audio stories.                     |
| **Religious or political climate** | “Are there things people won’t say in front of certain groups?” | A Muslim girl avoided discussing religious discrimination in the presence of local authorities. |

### 📣 Story Prompts:
* "Tell me about what it’s like to share stories here. Are there things people avoid saying?"
* "What makes it easier—or harder—for people in your community to open up?"

## 🛟 SECTION 4: How to Document These During a Session

Use a **simple field notebook** or **this observation table** to capture insights:

| Category           | What Happened | My Reflection | What to Do Differently Next Time |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Preconditions      |               |               |                                  |
| Risks              |               |               |                                  |
| Contextual Factors |               |               |                                  |

* **Use open-ended prompts.** Let people speak in their own way.
